Welcome back to your journey through competitive programming! ACM ICPC at UCLA is back with Beginner CP: a continuation of the popular Introduction to Competitive Programming workshop from Fall 2020. We really enjoyed seeing you last quarter and can’t wait to share what we have in store for you this time.

In Beginner CP, we will explore even more beginner-friendly themes in competitive programming. Whether you are completely new to CP, an expert looking for a quick review, or just an algorithm and problem-solving enthusiast, we promise you will find the workshops interesting and fun! Our exciting lineup of topics: Ad-hoc and Math problems, Dynamic Programming, Graph Searching, Trees, and Game Theory.

This quarter, we are also experimenting with contest problem editorials, which (alongside our weekly Office Hours) should help you to solve the entire contest after it has ended! :)) We also have a point system based on participation — and at the end of the quarter, the attendee with the most points will receive a special prize!

## Session 1: Welcome and Ad-hoc
For our first workshop, we briefly go over competitive programming and get our hands dirty with some interesting problems. To help you with the I/O, we will provide code templates only for this workshop. I/O is also an important part of competitive programming and hopefully the templates will get you started. Check out the Session 1 directory for the contest editorials (TBA) and the code templates for both the example and contest problems.
